I composed each piece by adding a feature at a time, making aesthetic choices by repeated close listening. As a result of this process, some features were refined, others were dropped. Finally, the identity of each piece emerged. ...it is generally thought that programmers implement their ideas on a computer with as few unforeseen developments as possible ... From the vantage point of an artist, though, it is just as easy to see the flow going in the opposite direction: the medium reveals itself as the artist proceeds, and such revelations shape the direction in which the artist continues. This interaction between artist and medium, and the intimacy it suggests, is no different for a computer artist. (Bischoff, 1991, p. 1 .)
