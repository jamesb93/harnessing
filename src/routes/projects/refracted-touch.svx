After composing both [Stitch/Strata]({m.ss}) and [Annealing Strategies]({m.as}) I felt as if the techniques and approaches that were explored in these works had little room to be developed. I discuss and reflect on this in ["Reflecting On The Balance Of Human And Computer Agency"]({m.ss}#reflecting-on-the-balance-of-human-and-computer-agency) and ["Reflecting On Issues Of Control And Intervention"]({m.as}#reflecting-on-issues-of-control-and-intervention). At this time, the [ELISION Ensemble](https://www.elision.org.au) were in Huddersfield as guest artists and I put myself forward to write a piece for [Daryl Buckley (Electric Guitar)](https://twitter.com/darylelision?lang=en) and Electronics. [Refracted Touch]({m.rt}) was composed for this.

Alongside the audio recording of this piece, the patch used in the performance alongside its predecessors is available in a github repository. The [final patch is linked here](https://github.com/jamesb93/refracted-touch/tree/main/patcher_versions/Refracted%20Touch), and the [repository is linked here](https://github.com/jamesb93/refracted-touch).

## Motivations and Influences
A major part of my motivation for writing Refracted Touch was to take the opportunity of working with a professional instrumentalist and performer, Daryl Buckley. Despite not having a clear or formal plan for what this work would be, I always envisaged it would be based on improvisation and real-time electronics, between Daryl and a content-aware computer system. In addition to these motivations, the last two pieces, [Stitch/Strata]({m.ss}) and [Annealing Strategies]({m.as}), had explored compositional workflows in which I engaged the computer with different levels of agency and relinquished different forms of control. I thought that this would be a good opportunity to see how a real-time, interactive content-aware system might be able to foster different modes of agency and compositional workflow.

As such, this piece is improvisational and grounded in Daryl interacting in real-time with the computer which dynamically generates responses depending on what he plays. The machine listening component of the piece is based mostly on detecting and measuring changes in amplitude, as well as recycling the real-time input of the slide guitar in a number of ways. To structure this improvisation, a loosely pre-composed form is flexibly stretched or compressed by the performer by altering the improvisational character and behaviour of their playing between soft and loud extremes.

This is a unique piece in the portfolio of this PhD, because it was the least successful in terms of developing my compositional workflow and exploring the role of the computer in my practice. Most of all, this piece helped to clarify further what I am willing to relinquish to the computer, and what aspects of composition I want to maintain control over.

### Musical Influences
Daryl and I worked on this piece remotely up until the rehearsals just before the performance of the piece. Given that we both live in different countries, our main method of communicating and sharing ideas involved me asking questions and Daryl providing recordings and short videos of techniques and sounds that he could produce. This was a large source of inspiration and guidance for me, as it outlined some constraints of what was possible, but also gave me an idea about what the electronics might do such that their interactions with Daryl would be aesthetically coherent.

In addition to the footage Daryl provided, I listened and watched as much material of his playing that was available online, examples of which can be found in VIDEOs [1]({m.rt}#vid1), [2]({m.rt}#vid2), [3]({m.rt}#vid3), [4]({m.rt}#vid4), [5]({m.rt}#vid5).

I also have some experience playing the guitar, but not extensively and would consider myself amateur. I experimented with extended techniques and preparations such as bowing with a cello bow, inserting nails and paper clips and attaching pegs to strings. Despite not being able to replicate Daryl's playing or draw on his expertise, it provided a way of having tangible experimentation outside of only using digital samples. Working almost entirely remotely and only with test samples, the piece remained in a highly speculative state for much of its development. This had a significant effect on the outcome, as I was never really working with the exact sounds that would feature in the performance. 

### Machine Listening for Formal Development
Dealing with compositional structure and form with the aid of the computer has been a focus in all of the projects so far. In [Refracted Touch]({m.rt}), I envisaged that the computer would be able to influence the form of the piece dynamically by operating within predefined constraints determining interactive relationships and configurations. By Daryl improvising with the machine, specific micro- and meso-level events would not have to be designed but would emerge from content-aware responses produced by the machine. In this vein, I looked to other works where live electronics and interactive systems were used to structure pieces in-the-moment and where the computer was responsible in some way for the structural and temporal aspects of a work. In this regard, Martin Parker's set of [gruntCount pieces](https://sumtone.bandcamp.com/album/gruntcount-improvised-pieces-for-player-and-computer) were influential. Parker describes the system as: 

<div class="bigquote">

*Each edition of gruntCount is personalised from the outset, with composer and performer working together to produce the elements of a system for creating well-­‐defined and structured musical pieces that invite liberal performer input, spontaneity and intuition. In the bass clarinet version (2012-­‐14), this preparatory stage involved a period of system "training", in which the composer engaged in real-­‐time free improvisations between himself and the player, creating at speed a unique set of interrelated DSP parameter presets... Having designed these settings, gruntCount’s compositional agenda proceeds with the plotting of various journeys or curves through the DSP settings. These curves may resemble a graph or automation curve, but in fact represent specific trajectories through a parameter space, which itself has nested settings within it. There is a formal design here, a quality and style, and yet the manner in which the piece is individuated is entirely defined by the live performer, whose physical efforts (or "grunts") move the assemblage forward.*  (Parker & Furniss, 2014, p. 1) 

</div>

The technicalities of this piece are straightforward. An onset detector generates "grunts", which progress the Max patch forward through a set of predefined states. These states are flexibly designed by the instrumentalist. As such, there is negotiation between what the performer creates beforehand and how that is navigated in real-time by triggering grunts. This is relatively simple, but powerful in creating variation and fostering expression through interaction. Furthermore, it blends the intuition and musicality of the performer while creating a space in which the performer can explore that idea interactively within a set of formal constraints. Parker gives a demonstration of how the patch works in [VIDEO 6]({m.rt}#vid6)

Similarly, the work of Owen Green from his PhD thesis was influential to me. I largely drew on signal processing concepts from two pieces, *[Danger in the Air](http://owengreen.net/portfolio/danger-in-the-air/)* (2013) and *[Cardboard Cutout](http://owengreen.net/portfolio/cardboard-cutout/)* (2013). *Danger in the Air*, features live electronic components that adaptively respond to the input of the performer and occupy a range of agent-like behaviours from sound processing module to co-player. From this work I was inspired by the way that Green made the electronic processing transform over the duration of the piece by having the real-time granular synthesiser's parameters adapt to the sound of the input through audio description and digital signal processing. This adaptivity and temporal evolution was something that I wanted to capture in my own efforts. *Cardboard Cutout*, uses signal decomposition to separate harmonic from percussive components from a live input signal, in this case a bowed cardboard box. Each of these layers is processed with granulation and similar to *Danger in the Air* the granular synthesis adapts and is responsive to the qualities of the input signal through audio descriptors. Green's approach to time and form in this work is constructed as a negotiation between pre-composed sections and the behaviour of the performer which drives a sequencer that moves between those sections. Green describes his approach as follows:

<div class="bigquote">

*The modulation of the various processes at work in the patch is driven, in large part, by a sequencer that moves through a series of pre-defined steps (see Figure 8.3 on p. 202 in the technical documentation below for details of this).The progression of the sequence is still driven by player input, however, so whilst the ordering and certain temporal aspects of the electronic processing are determinate, their precise pacing is adaptive.* (Green, 2013, p. 195)

</div>

In the later versions of the [Refracted Touch]({m.rt}) patch, I implemented something similar, where pre-composed states are progressed through according to the accumulated "energy" of the performer's input signal. Most importantly though, both of these approaches by Green and Parker focus on how they can balance the liveliness of content-aware improvisational systems and their own control over such systems. This was an aspect that I had not explored in previous pieces and wanted to experiment with further for myself.

## The Patch
Refracted Touch was developed by iteratively developing a patch and by using pre-recorded materials derived from my own guitar playing and from Daryl. These versions are not necessarily functional performance patches and can be considered intermediate testing, trialling and sketching that culminated toward the final version. This section will briefly describe what each patch version does and situate it in the development of the piece. As such, I will separate this section into two sub-sections, ["Earlier Versions"]({m.rt}#earlier-versions), which describes all but the versions leading up to the final version, and ["The Final Version and Performance"]({m.rt}#final-version-and-performance) which shows in more detail the final form of the patch and the results it produced in the first and only performance.

### Earlier Versions
#### Version One
I began composing Refracted Touch by collecting and making sounds, recording them and then building signal processing modules with those sounds as inputs. These signal processing modules were not conceived as just digital audio effects, but self contained processes that would produce the sound in adaptive and responsive ways using audio descriptors and signal processing. I have provided some context for other interactive electronic works, in ["Machine Listening for Formal Development"]({m.rt}#machine-listening-for-formal-development) that influenced me to pursue this, and much of my thinking and experimentation at this early stage of the piece was based on looking at their code, listening to their work and drawing those sources into my own experimentation and programming.

The first module I created was a harmonic percussive source separator. I started with this module as an intuitive choice and experimented on the assumption that aspects of amplified slide guitar playing from Daryl could be separated with this decomposition model and treated in isolation. This might give me access to distinct sounds *within* his playing which could be exploited by the computer. For example, Daryl often strikes the strings of the slide guitars with metallic objects such as the bar and slide. This has a strong percussive attack, followed by the harmonic resonance of the amplified guitar with some feedback. I wanted to see if these elements could be separated from each other in the electronics, and if this could render new material or function as an effect. [VIDEO 7]({m.rt}#vid7) gives an example of this process on some sampled slide guitar techniques with heavily detuned strings.

<VideoMedia2 
url="/rt/hpss-demo"
figure="VIDEO 7"
caption="Demonstration of the harmonic percussive separator process using Daryl's playing as an input signal."
id="vid7"
/>

In particular, I found the percussive extraction the most novel. When the harmonic component was removed, the expression of articulations and attacks was transformed, and the identity of the source was changed radically. I decided to keep the percussive and harmonic components in buffers. In the first version of the patch, the last few seconds of sound was continually being separated and maintained in memory. This construct persists through the various versions of the patch and real-time signals of source separated sounds are used by other sound producing modules. 

*Short Resonators (demonstrated in [VIDEO 8]({m.rt}#vid8)*
- 32 [CNMAT `resonators~`](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu/content/resonators) in parallel excited by a noise source.
- Each resonator can be set by providing a list of three values, the frequency, the gain and a triplicate which determines the decay.
- The harmonic component is analysed by the `sigmund~` object to produce a set of data describing the sinusoidal components. This gives the frequency and relative gains of those sinusoids which is then used to control the `resonators~`.
- An amplitude onset detector, triggers an envelope that allows the `resonators~` to sound momentarily when the guitar is hit.
- The intended effect is that the `resonators` will resonate "in tune" with the guitar, albeit imperfectly due to the discrepancies between the `sigmund~` analysis, creating a hybridised sound between the guitar attacks and the parallel filter bank resonance.

/>

*Metallic Feedback*

- This module is composed from two identical feedback comb filters that are connected in series.
- They have two parameters: a delay time and a feedback amount.
- They are self-modifying, as the output gets louder the feedback amount is lowered. The feedback will never exceed 1.0 and attenuating it in this way helps to control it and stop it from becoming overpowering all the time as well as creating slight variation in response to the input signal.
- The delay time is modulated to a random value between 1 and 7.9 milliseconds for the first metallic feedback module and 7.34 and 9 milliseconds for the second one. The different delay times and the way that they are connected in series creates complex morphing properties to the processing ranging from tight feedback "plucks" to longer metallic resonances.
- The output of the short resonators is connected to the input of the first feedback comb filter making an already resonant and tonal sound become temporally stretched, metallic and giving the impression that that material is being recycled.
    
*Granular Synthesis* 

- The  portion of the most recent input from the percussive component is used as the source for a granular synthesis module. This enables the granular synthesis to be dynamic when generating grains, as well as creating a feeling that material is being recycled by the computer. The parameters for this are manually fixed to create a textural companion to the input sound. A demonstration is provided in [VIDEO 10]({m.rt}#vid10)

id="vid10"
/>

*Cubic Nonlinear Distortion*
- This module is a cubic nonlinear distortion module that in addition to adding harmonics to the input signal can alter the dynamics of the input sound.

The gen code for this is shown in [CODE 1]({m.rt}#code1) and a demonstration can be found in [VIDEO 11]({m.rt}#vid11)

<Code2

```js
cnld(xin, offset, drive) {

	offset = clip(offset, 0., 1.);
	drive = clip(drive, 0., 1.);

	pregain = pow(10., (2. * drive));
	x = clip(((xin + offset) * pregain), -1., 1.);
	cubic = x - (x*x*x)*(0.3333333333);

	return dcblock(cubic);
}

/* + 1x or 2x more dcblocker after downsampling process */

out1 = cnld(in1, in2, in3);
```

</Code2>

<VideoMedia2 
url="/rt/cnld-demo"
figure="VIDEO 11"
caption="Cubic non-linear distortion module with two different samples from Daryl"
id="vid11"
/>

Alongside the sound processing modules, I began creating modules that could create change in the modules over time. These would create or interpret events (such as those from onsets), or drive modifications to parameters in response to the input signal. I decided on an approach of *accumulation*, whereby the values of the incoming live signal are measured and accumulated up to a specified limit. Once the limit has been reached the accumulator resets and triggers a generic event that can be used to cause changes elsewhere in the patch. An example of this is demonstrated in [VIDEO 12]({m.rt}#vid12)

<VideoMedia2 
url="/rt/accumulation"
figure="VIDEO 12"
caption="Example of accumulation with a sample as input. The original audio is played back through the left channel, and a single sample impulse is triggered in the right channel ever time the accumulator resets."
id="vid12"
/>

From this process different interactions can be set up. For example, the envelope length of the resonator module is based on the interval between resets of the harmonic components accumulator. The more harmonic energy that is put into the system, the longer the envelopes become. When the same harmonic accumulator resets, the resonator itself is toggled between the on and off status. My thinking in this regard was that this would make the resonator interactive and playable over longer time scales, rather than having all interactions coupled to local changes.  In the first version of the patch I noted some imagined applications where this idea of accumulation might be useful.

```
The timers could be used for....

--------------------------------------

1. Controlling the rate of something
2. Establishing envelope lengths
```

```
The bangs could be used for...

--------------------------------------

1. Engaging long form changes
2. Turning elements of a system on/off
3. Creating harmonic swells (resonators~)
```

```
The raw signal could be used for...

--------------------------------------

1. Pushing an envelope forward
2. Scrubbing through a buffer
3. Alternating between resonator banks
4. Pushing the prevalence of certain systems up/down (long form stuff)
```

This idea of accumulation manifested in this first version and remained in the periphery of the work across different versions. In the final version of the patch it evolved as a pivotal mechanism for driving form through the interactions between Daryl and the computer.

#### Version Two
In the second version of the patch developments are made to how the granular synthesis module works. I found that although I liked the *idea* of granulating the percussive component of the input signal, the result was often overpowering and homogenous, especially with larger grain sizes. To mitigate this and to increase the expressiveness of the granular synthesis module, I made it able to modify its own parameters in response to the input signal. For example, instead of constantly triggering the generation of new grains at a fixed rate, this aspect would be determined by the amplitude of the input signal so louder playing makes the generation of grains faster. Similarly, the time offset of grain generation (where in the buffer the grain starts) is dependent on a phasor that increases in speed with amplitude. Transposition is also modulated in the same way. [IMAGE 1]({m.rt}#img1) depicts the annotated patch for this module.

<ImageMedia2
url="/rt/adaptive-granular.jpg"
caption="Adaptive granular synthesis module."
figure="IMAGE 1"
id="img1"
/>

In addition to the granular synthesis changes, a new module titled *low* was created. This module consisted of an onset detector designed to respond to changes between consecutive spectral frames, which is connected to a playback mechanism. The onset detector worked better than other amplitude-based algorithms at detecting changes when slide guitar playing involves heavily detuned strings, or the pitch is synthetically altered by pedals. When these onsets are triggered, it selects random sections from the harmonic component buffer and plays them back at a reduced playback speed. This idea was influenced by the way that in his recorded improvisations, Daryl would strike heavily detuned strings to create metallic almost non-instrumental sounds. I experimented by stretching recordings of this out in REAPER and liked the way that this could transform from attack-based to textural material. In real-time, I imagined that this would provide a contrasting behaviour to Daryl's often erratic style of playing.

#### Version Three/Four
Version three and four are incredibly similar, with the later version mostly implementing fixes to problems and changing the cosmetic aspects of the patch. As such, I've decided to group them together. These versions began to progress towards the finalised patch and piece. Several modules were added and there was additional focus on creating mechanisms from which form could emerge from the interaction between Daryl and the computer.

Some new modules with highly specific sound producing capabilities were added to the patch. These new modules and the existing ones were grouped into four different patch groups. This was both pragmatic (so that they could be switched on and off dynamically to conserve processing power). On a structural level, this grouping was also representative of how I planned for the computer to dynamically shift between different states of operation. As such, each group of modules produces a different musical behaviour and is predicated on responding to different aspects of live input from Daryl.

**rt.bits**

This group of modules performs real-time descriptor-driven concatenative synthesis. After experimenting with granular synthesis, resonators and feedback, I wanted to incorporate some of the samples I had made with a dobro guitar into the computer's synthesis possibilities.

**rt.harmfoc**

This module group initially included the resonators patch from version one alongside a new spectral freeze. After some deliberation, I removed the resonators module, finding that the spectral freeze module was potent enough at creating sympathetic harmonic responses from the computer.

**rt.low**

This module group added two new companions on the "low" module described in ["Version Two"]({m.rt}#version-two). The first is an additional response to the onset detector which focuses on low frequency sounds. When an onset occurs, a fuzz-bass sample is played back to supplement the slowed down playback of harmonic material. The second is a feedback delay network with a heavy compressor situated between the feedback component. This second addition was created by heavily modifying the *metallic feedback* module from [version one]({m.rt}#version-one) of the patch.

**rt.disruptor**

This last module includes the cubic nonlinear distortion module and the granular synthesis module. In Daryl's playing he manages to achieve very synthetic sounds that sound as if they were produced digitally or with a synthesiser. I wanted some possibility for there to be mimicry between those types of sounds and something generated by computer. To realise this, I introduced the fourses synthesiser from [Annealing Strategies]({m.as}) as a module.

Much of my thinking up to this point was that the formal aspects of the work would be governed by the state of the modules. Switching them on and off, or modifying parameters were to me the only way to shape the piece through the interaction between Daryl and the computer. Each module had been designed and conceived of with certain material types in the first place, so I theorised that a "state" detector that could alter the internal components of the patch in response to the input of the guitar signal could be a way that the machine could be dynamic, while also being cohesive with the performer. In addition to this, I envisaged that this strategy might introduce a level of flexibility for the performer and provide them with a way to interact with the computer in order to influence the form of the piece. Depending on his in-the-moment listening, Daryl could decide to maintain a single idea for as long as needed or explore the localised behaviours of a state before moving on at his own pace. From the inverse perspective, I also imagined that this would give the computer some ability to be more divergent in the construction of form in real-time by creating a kind of "game", whereby the performer is working either with or against the behaviour of that process.

In my first attempt to realise this, I used the [mubu](https://ismm.ircam.fr/mubu/) Max package, specifically the `mubu.gmm` object. This object uses a gaussian mixture model to compare live input data against a set of trained exemplars and produces a set of values that determine the confidence it has that the incoming data is represented by the trained exemplars. This is shown in [VIDEO 13]({m.rt}#vid13) I used mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients by analysing audio files of extended techniques played provided by Daryl to attach some musical behaviours to exemplars. 

<VideoMedia2 
url="/rt/gmm-demo"
figure="VIDEO 13"
caption="State recognition with mubu.gmm"
id="vid13"
/>

Using audio samples as input I tested this in practice by having the classified state turn groups of modules on and off. I found that the classification process was extremely temperamental. Sometimes even the same input data would not necessarily be classified in the same group that it was trained as. Furthermore, the confidence output was too brittle to determine or measure the balance of states and the results were often heavily weighted towards one result. I envisaged that an interesting interactive relationship might emerge if the performer was able to operate in between states. However, the reality of both performing the right type of material to do this, and for it to be measured accurately began to introduce a number of contingencies that I would not even be able to test until the rehearsal. As such I decided not to develop this idea further.

In the final version of the patch I removed state classification with machine learning from [version four]({m.rt}#version-4). However, I still wanted to leverage this idea of the computer automatically shifting between states where different modules were activated or deactivated in various combinations. To do this I took a much simpler approach in which a set of pre-composed states are progressed through linearly in a preset order. The duration of each state, and thus the rate at which these are navigated though is dependent on a process of *amplitude accumulation*, a mechanism that was experimented with in previous versions. While each state is active, the amplitude of the input signal is accumulated up to a specified limit. Once this limit is reached, the state ends and the next one in the linear series begins. Playing quietly could make a state last longer than playing loudly or stopping playing entirely could extend a state infinitely. Each state enables different combinations of modules from the four groups. This governs the overall nature of the piece at the highest level of form, while micro- and meso-level detail emerges from Daryl interacting with the specific modules and the relationships they are designed to have with the input signal. 

### Final Version and Performance
Each state is also accompanied with a set of text-based prompts that are delivered to Daryl remotely. He used an iPad in the performance, where the text was presented to him in real-time alongside other information such as his current "progress" through a state. This is depicted in [IMAGE 2]({m.rt}#img2).

<ImageMedia2

figure="IMAGE 2"
id="img2"
/>

I found this overall system simple to express to Daryl as well as malleable. If either of us wanted a state to last longer overall, all that was required was to increase the limit for the state. Through this simple approach there was enough flexibility for Daryl to shape the structure of the piece while still being constrained by the deterministic aspects that I imposed by ordering and designing the states.

#### Patch States and Performance
To discuss the relationship between patch states and the navigation between these negotiated by Daryl and the computer it is relevant to now look at the performance itself and to observe how each state manifested and the kinds of musical behaviours that emerged. The following recording is taken from the performance of the piece which occurred in St Paul's Cathedral at the University of Huddersfield. The setup of electronics and amplification is detailed in [IMAGE 3]({m.rt}#img3). Despite having access to the raw electronic outputs from the recording I decided not to use them and instead have used a recording from a single X/Y pair of microphones situated in the centre of the room. I think that this gives a more natural representation of the performance and how the speaker positioning would have affected the experience of hearing the piece.

The following list enumerates the states and points to the times in the recording where they start and finish. The maximum accumulation value is given for each, as well as the instructions that were delivered to Daryl on his iPad.

**One | 0:00 - 1:01**
- Maximum Accumulation: 75
- *Use high to extreme register mostly*
- *Use volume pedal to blend effects + natural sound*
- *experiment with dynamics - processing crushes more when louder*
- *small, delicate articulations*

**Two | 1:01 - 1:09**
- Maximum Accumulation: 75
- *Extremely light, fragile articulations*
- *Occasional intense bursts*
- *Guitar samples are matched to onsets*
- *Slide + bar percussively*

**Three | 1:09 - 2:06**
- Maximum Accumulation: 900
- *"Catch" the electronics, play off their behaviour*
- *More frequent bursts of intensity*
- *Use more range*

For these first three states the electronics occupy a background role and the overall dynamic of both Daryl and the electronics  is intended to be quiet. I wanted the guitar and the electronics to be hard to discern from each other and to be interwoven texturally and behaviourally. There is light processing from the cubic nonlinear distortion throughout, and states two and three progressively introduce modules from the *rt.bits* group of modules. These modules perform descriptor-based concatenative synthesis using samples of  extended techniques on a dobro guitar and from modular synthesis. The samples are selected and concatenated based on measuring the input signal of the guitar in terms of spectral centroid and amplitude, with the intention that the morphology of the sound produced from this process will be responsive to Daryl's playing. In addition to this, from state three amplitude onsets from Daryl trigger pre-composed gestural controls that dictate the selection of samples. This is demonstrated in [AUDIO 1]({m.rt}#aud1), a selection from 1:10 to 1:40 which has been isolated in the performance recording.

Daryl also has very limited accumulation to play with in the first two states, which encourages him to be reserved compared to the rest of the piece.  

**Four | 2:06 - 2:33**
- Maximum Accumulation: 900
- *Increase intensity of articulations*
- *Patch will freeze harmonic moments, exploit this*
- *Granular synthesis will intermittently join you, work with it when it does*
- *Onset-based electronics now follow your intensity*

This fourth state functions as a bridge to the next state. Daryl is given significantly more accumulation room to play with, but at the same time the electronics are increasing in intensity and additional modules are introduced such as the harmonic freeze from *rt.harmfoc* as well as the granular synthesis from *rt.disruptor*. Daryl exploited the intense nature of the granular synthesis to generate an unrelenting texture that is noisy and overpowering. Due to the positioning of the speaker emitting the electronics though, this texture is diffused into the room and blends with the other sounds.

**Five | 2:33 - 3:23**
- Maximum Accumulation: 2000
- *Use a range of techniques*
- *Wild, explosive gestures*
- *Synthesiser changes with onsets*
- *Work against and with preset changes*

State five is the first major shift in the piece in which the modules from the first four states are mostly turned off and a new combination of sound producing and processing types are enabled. Most significantly, the fourses synthesiser becomes active and starts randomly selecting from pre-designed presets in response to amplitude onsets from Daryl. This interaction plays out well and is more obvious in the sound output, whereas in previous states the interactions are concealed or harder to detect from the listeners perspective. Through Daryl's control he created some satisfying moments of tension and space. At 3:41 Daryl causes the fourse synthesiser to change preset and immediately restricts his playing, allowing a moment of reprieve in which low frequency oscillations are diffused into the performance space. Just before this at 3:32, Daryl seemed to be avoiding triggering an onset in order to create a small passage that increases in intensity gradually over time. This range of play with the simple onset detection mechanism allows for Daryl to structure the micro- and meso-scale form within this state through his decision making and playing.

**Six | 3:23 - 4:20**
- Maximum Accumulation: 500
- *Do almost nothing in this section*
- *Let the synthesiser take the foreground for some time*
- *Perform intermittent interjections to activate the granular synthesis*
- *Ornament the synthesiser*

State six has the role of setting aside some time for a reprieve in the piece. I put this there in order to give the listener and Daryl a break from both the intensity of the sounds that came before in state five, and for him to assume a more relaxed and background role amongst the static texture produced by the electronics.

**Seven | 4:20 - 6:03**
- Maximum Accumulation: 3000
- *Use only strings 6, 5, 4*
- *Repeatedly strike strings while detuning with benders*
- *Low drone follows your playing*

Daryl continues to extend and reuse techniques and gestures from state six. I imagined that this state would encourage more tightly coupled interaction, by having Daryl trigger the *rt.low* module repeatedly while striking low detuned strings. Instead, Daryl compromised between these instructions and the relatively relaxed nature of state six to create a sparser rendition of what I intended. From this, a range of coupling and decoupling behaviours between himself and the computer is explored by switching between registers of his guitar. The high, almost shrieking gestures do not activate the *rt.low* module, and Daryl exploits this to improvise independently before moving to the lower register of his guitar to re-assimilate with the computer.

**Eight | 6:03 - 7:08**
- Maximum Accumulation: 3000
- *Use only strings 6, 5, 4*
- *Repeatedly strike strings while detuning with benders*
- *Electronics recycle material when you are not playing*
- *Create a dialogue with electronics*

State eight is somewhat of an extension to state seven in that all the same modules are active except for an additional sub-module of *rt.low* that plays back buffered harmonic material at a slow playback rate. Due to the reverse facing speaker this creates diffuse and ambient textures. Daryl continues to alternate between different registers in order to play around the interaction of onsets derived from low frequency playing.

**Nine | 7:08 - 8:39**
- Maximum Accumulation: 3000
- *Use only strings 6, 5, 4*
- *Repeatedly strike strings while detuning with benders*
- *Feedback seeps in when not playing*
- *Give space to the electronics*

The feedback module of the *rt.low* group enters the foray in state nine. [IMAGE 4]({m.rt}#image5) shows the patching for this module which uses four delay lines connected to filters and a compressor to automatically attenuate the volume and intensity of the feedback. The delay times dynamically change in response to onsets by selecting one of several predetermined presets.

Daryl sparingly activates the fuzz bass module and overall responds more directly to the feedback sound by matching it in intensity. Through his focused interaction with with the feedback module Daryl tapers the dynamics of this state towards the next one by simply waiting and choosing not to behave in such a way that will excite the feedback delay network too much, trigger the low fuzz sound or to create a low frequency onset that would trigger slow playback of buffered harmonic content.

**Ten | 8:39 - 9:53**
- Maximum Accumulation: 20000
- *Fiery, searing harmonic tones captured and held*
- *Granular synthesis will regurgitate — exploit this*
- *Finish with a rich cluster of feedback and frozen sounds*

State ten concludes the piece and focuses on sustaining sounds created by Daryl. The granular synthesis, feedback and harmonic freezer are the only modules active. Each of these modules are harder to interact with in a direct fashion due to the way that they process sounds. Because they all focus on elongating different aspects of what Daryl is doing, they appear to be more autonomous and decoupled from him. This creates a state that is suspended in time and is only concluded by Daryl stopping. 

## Reflection
Refracted Touch was an enjoyable piece to workshop and put together in the short time that I had with Daryl. Despite this, I think that many of the circumstances surrounding its creation made it difficult to compose, primarily because the design and experimentation in Max was highly speculative in terms of what Daryl could or might do in an improvisation. I was also testing entirely with samples that did not necessarily reflect the realities of live, real-time signal input. For Daryl and I, there were time constraints that we had to adhere to, as Daryl had other pieces to learn and perform in the short window of time leading up to the performance and so the patch was designed to mitigate failure and guarantee musical success as much as possible. This is perhaps antithetical to the openness of live interactive electronics, and this tension was at times difficult to deal with. 

Speaking from a position of reflection at the end of this PhD, I also believe that my compositional workflow is dependent on going through many stages of testing and failure in collaboration with the computer, in order to lead to better results and to realise what the *piece actually is*. In [Stitch/Strata]({m.ss}) it was through the challenges of balancing mine and the computer's agency that I eventually settled into a workflow where I was able to combine computer generated outputs and my intuition in creative decision making. Similarly, [Annealing Strategies]({m.as}) was successful because I was able to generate numerous outputs and select one that I found most aesthetically pleasing. There were undoubtedly more failed attempts from such a process than successful ones. This kind of iterated workflow with the computer was not fostered for [Refracted Touch]({m.rt}), and my only way of dealing with compositional materials was to speculatively design different sound producing modules, or to encourage Daryl to perform specific techniques through the iPad interface. I felt that the former had not enough effect on the overall piece or was temperamental at times, and the more that I constrained Daryl the less potent the entire notion of an interactive piece was.

I also think that the overall technological approach was too diffuse, and that I tried to incorporate too many sonic elements into the piece. In hindsight I would have reduced the number of modules to a subset that was more flexible, rather than having each module perform a specific musical role. Although not a conscious decision, my belief is that because I had limited time to rehearse and experiment in person with Daryl, I created a patch where I could remove modules if I needed to, rather than committing entirely to a smaller set of options that possessed more importance in the overall function of the computer system. After hearing the piece in performance and rehearsals I think that the final states, particularly five to ten, offered more expressive and varied ways for Daryl to interact with the computer especially over longer time scales and in relationships where the two were not so tightly coupled in their behaviour.

### Discrepancies Between Speculation and Reality
A majority of my speculative design methodology for the modules was based on them responding to specific imagined or designed aspects of the slide guitar. As an improvisational piece, many of these specific ideas never came to fruition and Daryl's style and approach was to explore broad sonic territories and gestural behaviours. In other words, I had implemented many modules that were responsive to aspects of an improvisation I might be interested in, but not necessarily what Daryl would or did do in the performance. For example, we can hear that for the first three states, the onset detection that provokes and controls the electronics doesn't necessarily align in a meaningful way with the gestures Daryl is performing. This difference largely arose because I was testing this interaction with my own samples, and the way that Daryl improvises is so vastly different from my style and performative behaviours. What Daryl and I consider to be extremely quiet were different, and while my artistic planning is necessary and fundamental to the creation of the piece, so is Daryl's comfort and expression as a performer interacting with the computer. In some cases, these two things did not end up coalescing in something which was interactively successful. Similarly, certain states ask the performer to use specific techniques or adhere to constraints such as strings or range. While these are not strict commands I designed the modules to work with certain materials that I had heard Daryl was able to produce in other recordings found online. Undoubtedly though, the natural flow of an improvisation sometimes leads improvisers elsewhere and at times it would not have made musical sense for Daryl to confine himself to those techniques in the moment. As such, the modules belonging to a certain state sometimes were incompatible with the material that Daryl was exploring at that moment in the improvisation.

These forms of discrepancies emerged in states six, seven, eight and nine, where I ask Daryl to only use the lowest pitched three strings (six, five and four). I planned for him to explore extremely low frequency material throughout these states, mainly informed by the sounds that I heard him produce in Matthew Sergeant's piece *[Lichen]({m.rt}#video5)* (2017) at [2:42](https://youtu.be/b9s-8BPXd58?t=162). In the performance though, states six to ten lasted for almost six minutes and I believe that this was too long and constraining for Daryl which is why he decided to explore other techniques and areas of his playing. This allowed him to excite and provoke the electronics in ways that I had not planned, such as in where high material is juxtaposed against the low, fuzzy and distorted electronics, although it diminished many of the core interactive relationships I had planned and set up.

### Final Remarks
After listening back to the dress rehearsal and performance recording, I was satisfied in some aspects of the approach, and to me the music was a result that I would not have been able to achieve through an intuitive approach. Despite these successes though, these aspects were not controllable or reproducible due to the sheer complexity of how interactive, real-time improvisational decision making occurs as well as how the sound modules were mostly indeterminate at a micro- and meso- scale and could change each time they were played with.

I came to a similar realisation in this reflection that I had experienced in the previous two pieces; that harnessing the computer for composition is a sensitive process of balancing my compositional control and the computer's contribution to the overall creative process. While I want the computer to influence the emergence of musical ideas and sounds, I need to be able to interact with what it does and build on these outputs. For me, being able to store, modify and have ways of incorporating materials in states of varied completeness is essential to this, but [Refracted Touch]({m.rt}) engendered a workflow that was not based on the creation of materials that could be collected like this. Instead, I had to operate through multiple layers of abstraction and distance. Firstly, I had to create modules to generate sound. Secondly I had to devise mechanisms to organise the behaviour of those modules. Lastly, I had to consider the complex role that a musician would have in this process. Given these issues, the paradigm of live electronics and improvisation was not a path forward from this piece that I believed would have value further in this research.

The next project that is discussed is [Reconstruction Error]({m.re}).  [Reconstruction Error]({m.re}) and [Interferences]({m.em}) are particularly important in the set of works for this PhD thesis in that they developed a computer-aided workflow that had more traction than these first three projects, and spurred on the generation of tools which I have integrated into my practice more deeply.
