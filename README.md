This is the code which generates my thesis: *Harnessing Content-Aware Programs For Computer-Aided Composition In A Studio-Based Workflow*. It is created with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and uses a node runtime.

How do I host this thesis locally?
`pnpm i`
`pnpm run dev`

How can I build it as a static site?
`pnpm run build`

How can I produce plain text from the written work?
`pnpm run convert` or `sh convert.sh`

How can I get a word count?
`pnpm run count` (requires `nltk` python package)
